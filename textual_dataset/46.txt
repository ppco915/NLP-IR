Microsoft Flight Simulator Has a Massive File Size of 127 GB
Based on everything we know about the game, this doesn't come as much of a surprise.

Microsoft Flight Simulator is targeting a highly specific audience, but even if this isn’t the kind of game you might be personally interested in, you can’t help but admire its ambition. The level of detail and authenticity it is going for is unmatched, its usage of cloud tech and what that tech is powering within the game is extremely impressive, and, of course, it’s also looking like it’ll be one of the most visually stunning games ever created.

Not surprisingly, then, all of that ambition is going to be reflected in the game’s file size as well, which we now know the specifics about with less than two weeks left until the game’s launch. The simulator’s Microsoft Store page was recently updated, and it confirms that it’ll have a massive file size of 127.01 GB. Clear up some space in your storage if you’re planning on diving into this one.

Microsoft Flight Simulator is out for PC on August 18. It will be available via Steam, Xbox Game Pass, and, of course, the Microsoft Store. It will also be receiving VR support post-launch.
