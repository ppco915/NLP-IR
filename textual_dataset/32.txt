This is what the inside of a tire looks like as you drive

They may not be as intriguing to learn about compared to an engine or transmission, but tires are just as vital—if not more so—to a vehicle’s operation. Hey, a car with nothing under the hood can still roll around even if only due to gravity. Without a set of tires, though? Not so much.

Why do we bring this up? Well, we come across in-depth looks at engines and transmissions all the time. This video recently uploaded by YouTuber Warped Perception, however, might be the first time we’ve seen a tire functioning up close. How close are we talking about? 

“I remove the tire from the rim then I mount the GoPro to the inside of the wheel and mount the tire back on the rim, mount the tire back on and re-install the wheel on the car,” Warped Perception says in his caption.

“Then I drive around and take a look at what it looks like the inside of the tire to see inside what the tire is going through as I drive through a bumpy road a smooth road and take turns at a higher speed.”

Yes, that’s footage from a GoPro mounted inside a car’s tire—the dude literally just stuck a camera, a small light, and a power bank to his wheel before installing his tire. It’s a simple enough concept and application, but the results are impressive. We’re given an inside look at how the tire adapts to different road conditions, and towards the end, we’re also treated to an awesome view of a deflating tire.

Frankly, we’re surprised it took someone this long to come up with a video like this. What other car components would you like to see operate from the inside? Let us know in the comments.
