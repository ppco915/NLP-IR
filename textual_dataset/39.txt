If a year ago 42.5 million laptops were sold, now it is 54.2 million. Such a sharp increase in shipments is explained by the transition of employees of many companies to remote work, and students and schoolchildren – to distance learning. In such conditions, users all over the world needed additional computer equipment.

The largest player in the market is Lenovo, which controls a quarter of the industry – 25.0%. HP is in second place with a score of 24.8%. Thus, these two companies supply half of all laptop computers.

“Bronze” went to Dell – 15.6%. Apple follows with 8.5%. Closes the top five Acer, whose share in the last quarter was 6.7%. All other laptop manufacturers collectively hold 19.4% of the global market.

Apparently, by the end of the current quarter, an increase in laptop shipments will also be recorded. Although the growth rate is likely to slow down.
